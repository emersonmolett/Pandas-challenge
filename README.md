This assignment builds off the previous Python learnings. The Pandas library was leveraged to analyze data within a CSV file. Code was written to produce output for:

<li>Total players</li>
<li>Purchase analysis (total)</li>
<li>Gender demographics</li>
<li>Purchase analysis (gender)</li>
<li>Purchasing analysis (age)</li>
<li>Top spenders</li>
<li>Most popular items</li>
<li>Most profitable items</li>

<br>

DataFrames were used throughout the Jupyter Notebook to display information. <br>

A written evaluation was also completed based on reviewing the data evaluated.
